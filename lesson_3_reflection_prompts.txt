When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  When my project is done, I would lile to push it to github to share with people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It's unnecessary to stay the local up-to-date the remote since we have to control

    the local.
