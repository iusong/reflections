When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  When my project is done, I would lile to push it to github to share with people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It's unnecessary to stay the local up-to-date the remote since we have to control
    files we want to push/pull or not. Not all commits by the folks we have to synchronize to
    the local.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
	git fork to clone repositories for a github account to another github account.
	git clone to copy the repository to the local. (local to local, alternatively)
	Branch consists of lots of commits you did.
    

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Make consistency between the local/origin and the remote.
    Make your trial or experiment on the local master.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I have to sendfing the update file to my collaborator by email. He/She will check the update, make some revision, write the comments and send it back to me. Lastly, I make the final updated.

    With Git and Github, I directly add the change on a branch and push to Gihub, create a pull request to show my collaborator. If everything is OK, there are no confilct in the branch. 
    I merge pull request. Everything is done. It is really fast.



When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
