What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	git init to create a new repository which contain all files in the current directory.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	We git add the files on working directory to git's staging area and get ready for git commit, which get the files into repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Using git status to check staging area whether empty or not;
	If it is empty, make sure the file only with one logical change and git add into staging area;
	git commit the file in staging area with commit message with clarity.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	"master" branch is default by git. git branch to check where we are. "git checkout + branch_name" to get to the branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	Since each commit has its own parent, it shows us the whole commit structure.
	git log --graph --oneline branch1 branch2 branch3... can help you
	visualize the branch structure.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
 	A single branch is formed by merging differenct branches. But the previous parent order of commits in each branch will be instead by time order. That's why we use the diagram to see the branch to be merged.
